        FOLDER MAKE-UP

Write a python program that will keep similar files in a common folder.
If folder not exist then first create the folder and then store

Eg - Suppose in this location "D:\ptestfor puython" some .mp3,.jpg
.jpeg and unknown file format are present.

so you have to keep all .mp3 in files in a folder like mp3files.If
any such folder exist before then don't create.

similar things have to be done with all other files.


    HINT - use os module to open any path
